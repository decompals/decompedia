# MWCC
MWCC is a commercial compiler by Metroworks (now owned by Freescale) as part of the CodeWarrior line of compilers and tools available for a large number of platforms. It is a proprietary compiler platform, unlike (GCC)[https://wiki.decomp.dev/en/compilers/GCC], which was licensed out to developers for use on their respective consoles.

## Identifying a Metroworks compiled binary

### A .comment Section

For unstripped binaries, some versions of the linker (MWLD) may include a comment string in a `.comment` section that can be used to indentify that the binary has been linked with a Metroworks linker. An example of such a string on the PS2 is the following: `MW MIPS C Compiler (2.4.1.01)`. Note that this does not necessarily identify the exact version of MWCC used, as this version number is generated by linker and a version number was often shared by multiple releases of MWCC. Further investigation will be required to identify the exact compiler version used.

### The Main Section

The default linker script for MWLD joins the text, data, and rodata sections into a single section called `main`. This can be an indicator that the binary may have been linked by MWLD.
