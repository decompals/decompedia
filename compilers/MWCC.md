# MWCC
MWCC is a commercial compiler by Metroworks (now owned by Freescale) as part of the CodeWarrior line of compilers and tools available for a large number of platforms. It is a proprietary compiler platform, unlike [GCC](/compilers/GCC), which was licensed out to developers for use on their respective consoles.

## Identifying a Metroworks compiled binary

### A .comment Section

For unstripped binaries, some versions of the linker (MWLD) may include a comment string in a `.comment` section that can be used to indentify that the binary has been linked with a Metroworks linker. An example of such a string on the PS2 is the following: `MW MIPS C Compiler (2.4.1.01)`. Note that this does not identify the exact version of MWCC used, as this version number is generated by MWLD and a version number was often shared by multiple releases of CodeWarrior. Further investigation will be required to identify the exact compiler version used.

This section is not present in GameCube releases of MWCC.

### The Main Section

The default linker script for MWLD joins the text, data, and rodata sections into a single section called `main`. This can be an indicator that the binary may have been linked by MWLD.

## Debug Information
### PS2
For PS2 ELF binaries that have been compiled with debug information that has not been stripped the information is stored in a `.debug` section containing DWARF 1 format debug information.

### GC
GameCube releases of MWCC supported generating debug information in DWARF 1 format as well as DWARF 2. DWARF 1 and 2 debug iformation is distinct in format and utilize a different structure of sections in the linked binary.
