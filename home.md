## What is this?

This site is dedicated to resources on video game decompilation.

Matching decompilation is the process of writing source code (typically C or C++) that compiles to the same exact binary as the original. This usually requires using the same compiler as the original game, with all source code being written from scratch.

Because matching decompilation is complex and time-consuming, dedicated communities have formed around the challenge. These communities have built a wealth of knowledge and tools to support the process.

## Platforms

While disassembly projects exist for pre-5th generation console games, full decompilation only became viable with the 5th generation, when games were primarily written in C and C++ rather than assembly.

The progress of video game decompilation largely depends on:

1) **Game complexity** – Older games tend to be simpler, making them easier to decompile.
2) **Availability of original compilers** – Without them, achieving a matching decompilation is nearly impossible.
3) **Community motivation** – Decompilation is a massive undertaking, relying on the dedication of passionate individuals.
