## What is this?

This site is dedicated to resources on video game decompilation.

Matching decompilation is the process of writing source code (C/C++) that compiles to the same exact binary as the original. This usually requires using the same compiler as the original game, but all source code is written from scratch.

Matching decompilation is a difficult and time-consuming process, leading us to develop close-knit communities of people passionate about decompiling games.
