<p>Revolution SDK is the low level toolchain distributed by Nintendo for Wii game and app development. Since the Wii does not boot into an operating system, this library was developed and distributed to act as an interface to the Wii's hardware. Internally it works by directly manipulating memory mapped hardware registers. Due to it being essential to doing pretty much everything, it is used in every game.<br><br>The SDK constists of various components, roughly corresponding to each piece of Wii hardware.<br>&nbsp;</p>
