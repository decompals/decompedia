Unlike most other systems, the GBA decomp scene does not have one unified community. However, the scene is still one of the most mature, with multiple complete decompilations and plenty of documentation. Due to the similarity of the consoles, some documentation and communities are shared with the [NDS](/platforms/nintendo-ds) scene.
