About
---
An in-progress decompilation of Disney's Alice in Wonderland (March 2010) for the [Nintendo Wii](https://wiki.decomp.dev/platforms/gamecube-wii).
The decompilation supports both versions of the game; SALP4Q (PAL) and SALE4Q (NTSC), however efforts are primarily focused on PAL. Neither region disc contains any further revisions that are known.

The repository is hosted on the [Alice-2010 Github organization](https://github.com/Alice-2010) and progress can be viewed on [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev/Alice-2010/Decomp).

There is no debug information for any version of the game.
There is DWARF information available for the [MAC build of XXL2](https://debugging.games/_files/Mac/[MAC]%20Asterix%20&%20Obelix%20XXL%202%20[Depot%20887062]%20[Manifest%20973368795952698114]%20(DWARF).7z) (from the 2018 Remaster, built upon the original 2006 game). This provides a lot of information for classes defined within the K engine.
