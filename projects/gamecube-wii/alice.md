About
---
An in-progress decompilation of Disney's Alice in Wonderland (March 2010) for the [Nintendo Wii](https://wiki.decomp.dev/platforms/gamecube-wii).
The decompilation supports both versions of the game; SALP4Q (PAL) and SALE4Q (NTSC), however efforts are primarily focused on PAL. Neither region disc contains any further revisions that are known.

The repository is hosted on the [Alice-2010 Github organization](https://github.com/Alice-2010) and progress can be viewed on [decomp.dev](https://decomp.dev/Alice-2010/Decomp).

There is no debug information in any version of the game.
