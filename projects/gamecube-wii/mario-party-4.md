## About
An in-progress decompilation of Mario Party 4 for the [Nintendo GameCube](/platforms/gamecube-wii) started in November 19th, 2023.

The project, found [here](https://github.com/mariopartyrd/marioparty4), currently mainly supports USA release pre-patch (GMPE01_00), but also all other versions: the patched USA release (GMPE01_01), PAL pre-patch (GMPP01_00) and patched (GMPP01_02), and the Japanese release (GMPJ01_00).

It currently has the most fully linked code so far, primarily because the original game was released without optimization.

## Other Games
Mario Party 4 shares some code from the previous Mario Party titles, mainly in the engine. However, most of the code is completely new, especially within the minigames themselves.

## Libraries
- dolphin
- musyx
